House Price Prediction (California Housing Data)

This project uses a Kaggle dataset containing information about housing prices in California during the 1990s.
It was created for learning purposes by following a YouTube tutorial and implementing the steps independently.

Key steps:

- Data Cleaning: handled missing values and removed nulls.

- Feature Engineering: transformed categorical features, and created new useful features from existing ones.

- Model Training: experimented with Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning.

- Result: Random Forest achieved the best performance.

This project was part of my journey to understand end-to-end ML pipelines.
